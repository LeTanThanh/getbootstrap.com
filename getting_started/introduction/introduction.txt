INTRODUCTION

Get started with Bootstrap, the world's most popular framework for building responsive, mobile-first sites, 
with BootstrapCDN and a template starter page.

QUICK START

Looking to quickly add Bootstrap to your project? Use BootstrapCDN, provided for free by the folks at StackPath.
Using a package manager or need to download the source files

  CSS

  Copy-paste the stylesheet <link> into your <head> before all other stylesheets to load our CSS

  <link rel="stylesheet" href="bootstrap.min.css">

  JS

  Many of our components require the use of Javascript to function. Specifically, they require jQuery, Popper.js and our Javascript plugins.
  Please the following <script>s near the end of our pages. right before the closing </body> tag, to enable jQuery must come first, 
  then Popper.js and then our Javascript plugins.

  We use jQuery's slim build, but the full version is also aupported.

  <script src="jquery.slim.min.js"></script>
  <script src="popper.min.js"></script>
  <script src="bootstrap.min.js"></script>

STARTER TEMPLATE

Be sure to have your pages set up with the latest design and development standards.
That means using an HTML 5 doctype and including a viewport meta tag for propper responsive behaviors.
Put it all together and your pages should look like this.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Hello world</title>

    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no">

    <!-- Bootstrap CSS -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="bootstrap.min.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello world</h1>

    <script src="jquery.slim.min.js"><script>
    <script src="popper.min.js"><script>
    <script src="bootstrap.min.js"><script>
  </body>
</html>

That's all you need for overall page requirements.
Visit the Layout docs or our official examples to start laying out your site's content and component. 

IMPORTANT GLOBALS

Bootstrap employs a handful of important global styles and settings that you'll need to be aware of when using it,
all of which are almost exclusively geared towards the normalization of cross browser styles.

  HTML 5 DOCTYPE

  Bootstrap requires the use of HTML 5 doctype.
  Without it, you'll see some funky incomplete styling, but including it shouldn't cause any considerable hiccups.

  <!doctype html>
  <html lang="en">
  ...
  </html>

  RESPONSIVE META TAG

  Bootstrap is developed mobile first,
  a strtegy in which we optimize code for mobile devices first then scale up components as necessary using CSS media queries.
  To ensure popper rendering and touch zooming for all devices, add the responseive viewport meta tag to your <head>

  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no">

  BOX SIZING

  For more straightforward sizing in CSS, we switch the global box-sizing value from context-box ro border-box.
  This ensures padding does not affect the final coouted width of an element,
  but it can cause problems with some thirdparty software link Google Maps and Google Custom Search Engine.

  One the rare accasion you need to override it, use something like the following

  .selector {
    box-sizing: content-box;
  }

  With the above snipet, nested elements - including generated content via ::before and ::after - will all inherit the specified box-sizing for that .selector

  REBOOT

  For improved cross-browser rendering,
  we use Reboot to correct onconsistencies across browsers and devices while providing slightly more opinionated resets to common HTML elements.
